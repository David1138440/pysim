Pysim lets you model and simulate and analyse dynamical systems. Setting up a simulation is done in Python,
as is the analysis afterwards. The simulations are however done in fast C++. This combination of Python
flexibility and the speed of C++ is one of the core concepts of Pysim.

## Pysim is all about:

* Standing on the shoulders of giants. Using tried and true open source libraries when possible
* Adaptability. Enabling users to model simple systems, or connect multiple systems into a large system of systems.
* Extendability. Letting the user model his own systems as separate packages, in C++ or Python
* Fitting in with the rest of the scientific Python stack, using numpy, matplotlib, pandas and other well known packages
