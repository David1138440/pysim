# Setting up an open source project
My first encounter with differential equations in high school was decidedly underwhelming.
I understood that there was numerous rules on how to solve them, and that one could devote
their entire life to understand these rules, and even make up new ones for particular hard
equations. It all seemed a little... boring, unlike most of the other parts of mathematics.
But at the same time our teacher stressed that differential equations are an extremely powerful
tool for describing the world around us. Years later university and my experiences as an engineer
have proven him right. 

# The background of Pysim
The work with Pysim actually started some time ago, in 2010 to be exact. After four years
of working with control algorithms for underwater vehicles at Saab I had a new job working
with nautical simulations at SSPA. At SSPA there are very sophisticated models of ships.
The models are based on solid physics combined with the long experience SSPA has in model
testing. The models are expressed as differential equations (you guessed it). The problem
were that the legacy software used to solve these equations was quite dated and no longer
maintained. So Pysim was born to replace it. The development have been ongoing ever since,
driven by the need of the simulations at SSPA. But at the same time Pysim is a quite general
tool, and could be used by others as well. So before my parental leave in 2016 I proposed to 
management that we should take Pysim open source. This would hopefully benefit the open source
society as a whole, and maybe also SSPA if there are external contributions to the project.
Management agreed to my propposal, which I am forever grateful. So here I am, launching Pysim,
a tool for simulation of dynamical systems as open source. I hope you will find it useful!
